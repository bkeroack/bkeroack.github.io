I'm proud to announce the first public release of [Elita](https://bitbucket.org/scorebig/elita), the continuous deployment engine I wrote
for ScoreBig in Python.

There still are a bunch of features I want to implement but we are using it routinely on a daily basis and it's pretty
stable so far.

Find it on PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/elita

The docs are here: http://elita.readthedocs.org (a little outdated but nothing major)

Feel free to ask any questions!
