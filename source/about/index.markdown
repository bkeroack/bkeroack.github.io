{% img /images/ben-k.jpg Me %}

I'm a Python, Go and Scala hacker living in LA. I'm interested in infrastructure automation, DevOps, distributed applications
and systems programming. I think CSS is an abomination and you would need to pay me a lot of money to pixel-push with it 
(but, hey, everybody has a price, right?).

Reach me at ben@keroack.com or on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/benjamen-keroack/60/b07/2a8).
